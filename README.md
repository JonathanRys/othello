# Othello

## Rules

The game begins with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two facing white side up, two pieces with the black side up, with same-colored disks on a diagonal with each other. Convention has initial board position such that the disks with black side up are to the north-east and south-west (from both players' perspectives), though this is only marginally meaningful to play (where opening memorization is an issue, some players may benefit from consistency on this). If the disks with black side up are to the north-west and south-east, the board may be rotated by 90Â° clockwise or counterclockwise. The black player moves first.

If neither player can move, the game ends. If the payer who's turn it is cannot make a move, they must pass otherwise

The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins. An exception to this is that if a clock is employed then if one player defaults on time that player's opponent wins regardless of the board configuration, with varying methods to determine the official score where one is required.
